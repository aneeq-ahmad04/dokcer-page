    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
        <p>Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, deploy, and run applications in containers. It allows for consistent and efficient deployment across different environments by packaging code, dependencies, and configurations together in containers.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is a Docker Container?</h2>
        <p>A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as code, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from one another, enabling multiple applications to run independently on the same machine.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is a Docker Image?</h2>
        <p>A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers. Images are often based on a preconfigured environment, like an OS or framework, and they allow you to quickly replicate and scale applications.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Docker Networking?</h2>
        <p>Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other, the host, or external networks. This is essential for building distributed applications and services that interact across multiple containers or even different physical machines.</p>
